# Output Videos

This directory will contain the stylized output videos generated by the Video Styler application.

## Automatic Creation

When you run the Video Styler application, output videos will be automatically saved to this directory (or wherever you specify with the `--output` parameter).

## File Naming Convention

Consider using descriptive names for your output files:
- `input_name_style_name.mp4`
- `landscape_starry_night_style.mp4`
- `portrait_watercolor_style.mp4`

## Video Properties

Output videos will maintain:
- Same resolution as input video
- Same frame rate as input video
- Same duration as input video
- Style transferred to each frame

## File Sizes

Note that output video file sizes may be different from input files due to:
- Compression settings
- Style transfer processing effects
- Output codec selection

## Quality Tips

For best results:
- Use high-quality input videos
- Choose appropriate style images
- Allow sufficient processing time
- Monitor disk space for large videos
